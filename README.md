Fetches Cheshire East bin collection schedule for a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) and serves an auto-updating `.ics` calendar at a public URL.

**Disclaimer**: This project is pulling data directly from Cheshire East from a non-public API, and may be unstable, or even disappear without notice.

To prevent abuse, there are a few built-in mechanisms to prevent needlessly hammering the upstream data source by default (do bin collections update _that_ frequently?!)
