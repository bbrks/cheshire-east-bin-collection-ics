Fetches Cheshire East bin collection schedule for a Unique Property Reference Number (UPRN) and serves an auto-updating `.ics` calendar at a public URL.

**Disclaimer**: This project is pulling data directly from Cheshire East from a non-public API, and may be unstable, or even disappear without notice.

To prevent abuse, there are a few built-in mechanisms to prevent needlessly hammering the upstream data source by default (do bin collections update _that_ frequently?!)

## Installation

### Running with Docker

    docker run -d -e UPRN="100012357047" -p 8080:8080 bbrks/cheshire-east-bin-collection-ics

### Running standalone

1. Download the [latest release binary](https://github.com/bbrks/cheshire-east-bin-collection-ics/releases)
 
2. Run the service with your UPRN:

## Configuration Options

- `-uprn="100012357047"`
  - Set the UPRN to fetch the collection schedule for
  - This is intentionally not parameterised in the public URL, to prevent accidentally hosting a public service ðŸ™ƒ
- `-updateInterval=24h`
  - Set how often the service looks for new data
  - Range: `24h` to `7d`
- `-addr="0.0.0.0:1234"`
  - Change the listen address/port

## Building from source

### Dockerfile
